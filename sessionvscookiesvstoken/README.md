# Difference between sessionid vs cookies vs token

# session
* When we are trying to login to a web page server will give a sessionid as cookies.
* Sessionid is a unique identifier automatically generated by server.
* Server will store this sessionid in database when we are trying to log in again it will not ask credentials again.
* This sessionId will validate for few minutes after exit from the web page.
* Session has only acess of subset of data.
* Session has grant acess to all the  information.
* session based approach is deployed when using the websites

# cookies
* cookies is a medium to move sessionid server to the browser.
* cookies are sent with http header to the client.
* When we are using cookies only two part involved user and server
* 
# token
* Token is like temporary password to authenticate user
* most popular authenticate tool is like oAuth,openId,jwt
* Using token user are able to retrive any transation information from database.
* Here multiple parties involved user,server and token generetor.
* some token need not session at all on server
* token has limited lifetime. when it expire then only new token will generate.
* token has grant acess to subset of data.
* tokens are send using autherization http header
* token based approach prefer when using the app in same server
